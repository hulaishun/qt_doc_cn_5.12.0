<h3 class="fn" id=""><a name=""></a>class Qt3DExtras::<span class="name">QDiffuseMapMaterial</span></h3>
<p><b>This class is obsolete.</b> It is provided to keep old source code working. We strongly advise against using it in new code.</p>
<p>The <a href="qt3dextras-qdiffusemapmaterial.html">QDiffuseMapMaterial</a> provides a default implementation of the phong lighting effect where the diffuse light component is read from a texture map.</p>
<p>This class is deprecated; use <a href="qt3dextras-qdiffusespecularmaterial.html">Qt3DExtras::QDiffuseSpecularMaterial</a> instead.</p>
<p>The specular lighting effect is based on the combination of 3 lighting components ambient, diffuse and specular. The relative strengths of these components are controlled by means of their reflectivity coefficients which are modelled as RGB triplets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambient is the color that is emitted by an object without any other light source.</li>
<li>Diffuse is the color that is emitted for rought surface reflections with the lights.</li>
<li>Specular is the color emitted for shiny surface reflections with the lights.</li>
<li>The shininess of a surface is controlled by a float property.</li>
</ul>
<p>This material uses an effect with a single render pass approach and performs per fragment lighting. Techniques are provided for OpenGL 2, OpenGL 3 or above as well as OpenGL ES 2.</p>
<p>This class was introduced in  Qt 5.7.</p>
