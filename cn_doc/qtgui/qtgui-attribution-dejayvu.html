  AMSFonts (v. 2.2) copyright

  The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the AMSFonts produced by and
  previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&amp;Y, Inc. are now freely
  available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
  cooperation
  of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&amp;Y.
  Members of this consortium include:

  Elsevier Science IBM Corporation Society for Industrial and Applied
  Mathematics (SIAM) Springer-Verlag American Mathematical Society (AMS)

  In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be
  held by
  the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any way
  the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
  distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
  into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
  applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
  faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
  removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
  any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
  Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
  has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
  given a different name.
