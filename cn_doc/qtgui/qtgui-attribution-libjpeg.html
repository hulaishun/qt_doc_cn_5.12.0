  libjpeg-turbo Licenses
  ======================

  libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

  - The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
    [README.ijg](README.ijg)

    This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
    (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)

  - The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

    This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
    well as the build system.

  - The zlib License, which is listed below

    This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
    SIMD extensions.


  Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
  =========================================

  This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
  best of our understanding.

  1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
      then:

      1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
          from the source.

          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License
          - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
          - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

      2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
          file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
          there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
          simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License
          - Clause 2 of the zlib License

      3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
          copyright or license text in that file.

          **Origin**
          - Clause 1 of the IJG License

  2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
      if you are distributing an application that statically links with
      libjpeg-turbo, then:

      1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

          This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
          Group.

          **Origin**
          - Clause 2 of the IJG license

      2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
          your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
          License.

          **Origin**
          - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

  3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
      contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

      **Origin**
      - IJG License
      - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

  4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
      free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
      consequences resulting from your use of the software.

      **Origin**
      - IJG License
      - Modified BSD License
      - zlib License


  The Modified (3-clause) BSD License
  ===================================

  Copyright (C)\&lt;YEAR\&gt; \&lt;AUTHOR\&gt;.  All Rights Reserved.

  Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

  - Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
    this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
  - Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
    this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
    and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
  - Neither the name of the libjpeg-turbo Project nor the names of its
    contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
    software without specific prior written permission.

  THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&quot;,

  ARE DISCLAIMED.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE
  LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF
  SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS
  INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
  CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
  ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


  The zlib License
  ================

  Copyright (C) \&lt;YEAR\&gt;, \&lt;AUTHOR\&gt;.

  This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
  warranty.  In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
  arising from the use of this software.

  Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
  including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
  freely, subject to the following restrictions:

  1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
     claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software
     in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
     appreciated but is not required.
  2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
     misrepresented as being the original software.
  3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.


  Why Three Licenses?
  ===================

  The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
  License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
  conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
  libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
  License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
  attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
  desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
  that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.
