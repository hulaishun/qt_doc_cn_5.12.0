<a name="psl"></a><p>The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:</p>
<p>- Avoid privacy-damaging &quot;supercookies&quot; being set for high-level domain name suffixes</p>
<p>- Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface</p>
<p>- Accurately sort history entries by site</p>
<p>Used in Qt Core to avoid &quot;supercookies&quot; being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkcookiejar.html">QNetworkCookieJar</a> class).</p>

  2. License Grants and Conditions
  --------------------------------

  2.1&#x2e; Grants

  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license:

  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
      modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
      Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
      as part of a Larger Work; and

  (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
      for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
      Contributions or its Contributor Version.

  2.2&#x2e; Effective Date

  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.

  2.3&#x2e; Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:

  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
      or

  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      its Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
  the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

  2.4&#x2e; Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
  License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
  permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

  2.5&#x2e; Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
  to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

  2.6&#x2e; Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.

  2.7&#x2e; Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1&#x2e;

  3. Responsibilities
  -------------------

  3.1&#x2e; Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
  the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
  Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
  License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
  attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
  Form.

  3.2&#x2e; Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
      Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
      than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
      the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

  3.3&#x2e; Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
  the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
  Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
  Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
  License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
  under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
  the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
  Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
  License(s).

  3.4&#x2e; Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
  or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
  the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

  3.5&#x2e; Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
  such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.

  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
  ---------------------------------------------------

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
  the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
  be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
  Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
  or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

  5. Termination
  --------------

  5.1&#x2e; The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
  notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
  first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
  Your receipt of the notice.

  5.2&#x2e; If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
  counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
  You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
  2.1 of this License shall terminate.

  5.3&#x2e; In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.

  *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot;       *
  *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
  *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
  *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
  *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
  *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
  *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
  *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
  *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
  *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
  *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
  *                                                                      *

  *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
  *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

  *  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
  *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
  *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

  *                                                                      *
  ************************************************************************

  8. Litigation
  -------------

  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
  place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
  cross-claims or counter-claims.

  9. Miscellaneous
  ----------------

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
  that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
  shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

  10. Versions of the License
  ---------------------------

  10.1&#x2e; New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.

  10.2&#x2e; Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
  or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.

  10.3&#x2e; Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
  any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
  such modified license differs from this License).

  10.4&#x2e; Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
