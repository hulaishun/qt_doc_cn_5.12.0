  PCRE2 LICENCE
  -------------

  PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
  and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

  Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the &quot;BSD&quot;
  licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
  redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the &quot;doc&quot; directory,
  is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
  testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

  The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
  included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
  optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
  the library is built.

  EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
  ------------------------------------------

  The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
  not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
  PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
  includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
  PCRE2 independently.
