<p>Furthermore, LLVM contains code from md5:</p>
<pre class="cpp plain">

  This is an OpenSSL-compatible implementation of the RSA Data Security, Inc.
  MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm (RFC 1321).

  This software was written by Alexander Peslyak in 2001.  No copyright is
  claimed, and the software is hereby placed in the public domain.
  In case this attempt to disclaim copyright and place the software in the
  public domain is deemed null and void, then the software is
  Copyright (c) 2001 Alexander Peslyak and it is hereby released to the

  (This is a heavily cut-down &quot;BSD license&quot;.)

  This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
  no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
  unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
  configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
  Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
  the properties of the two independent implementations.

  The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
  It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
  optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
  compile-time configuration.
