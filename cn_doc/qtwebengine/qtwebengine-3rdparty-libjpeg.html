  This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
  software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
  conditions:
  (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
  README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
  unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
  must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
  (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
  documentation must state that &quot;this software is based in part on the work of
  the Independent JPEG Group&quot;.
  (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
  full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
  NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
  not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
  acknowledge us.

  Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
  in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
  it.  This software may be referred to only as &quot;the Independent JPEG Group's
  software&quot;.

  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of

  ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
  sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
  ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
  by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
  that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
  ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
  of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
  the foregoing paragraphs do.

  The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf.
  It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
  The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
  ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
  by M.I&#x2e;T&#x2e; but is also freely distributable.

  It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
  patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
  legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
  support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
  (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
  Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
  So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
  code.

  The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
  To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
  been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
  &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
  resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
  GIF decoders.

  We are required to state that
      &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
      CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
      CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;
