  BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
  licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
  license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

  Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
  https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

  Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
  license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
  compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e&#x2e; both the conditions of the
  OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
  for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
  licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
  openssl-core@openssl.org.

  The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
  some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
  record keeping.)
