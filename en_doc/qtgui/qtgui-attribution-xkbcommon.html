  The following is a list of all copyright notices and license statements which
  appear in the xkbcommon source tree.

  If making new contributions, the first form (i.e&#x2e; Daniel Stone, Ran Benita,
  etc) is vastly preferred.

  All licenses are derivative of the MIT/X11 license, mostly identical other
  than no-endorsement clauses (e.g&#x2e; paragraph 4 of The Open Group's license).

  These statements are split into two sections: one for the code compiled and
  distributed as part of the libxkbcommon shared library and the code
  component of all tests (i.e&#x2e; everything under src/ and xkbcommon/, plus the
  .c and .h files under test/), and another for the test data under test/data,
  which is distributed with the xkbcommon source tarball, but not installed to
  the system.
